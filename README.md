### Requirements
-   Use PySpark to perform data processing on a large dataset
-   Include at least one Spark SQL query and one data transformation

### Project Explanation

In this project, I used GitHub codespaces and PySpark to extract, load, and transform data on police killings. I also executed a Spark SQL query that counted police killings by state and gender in 2015. Finally, I performed a data transformation to add a new column that groups states by their respective Census region. The output of these operations can be found in the "pyspark_output.md" file in this repository. 

The data used for this project was sourced from FiveThirtyEight's dataset on police killings in the United States in 2015. The data and documentation can be found here: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/police-killings
